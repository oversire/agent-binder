## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Package skeleton: the `AgentBinder` and `AgentBinderNative` products.
- The Claude driver: stream-json with the control channel (initialize, `can_use_tool`, interrupt, `set_model`), steer, a model probe and rate-limit windows.
- `ToolStatus.cancelled`: a tool that was open when the turn or the process ended.

### Known behavior

- Claude: the `init` event has no model name. The model is in the raw frame of the event.
- Claude: the pending permission inputs stay after a result and after the exit, as in the vendor wire.
